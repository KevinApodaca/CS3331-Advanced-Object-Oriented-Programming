/**
 * CS 3331 Advanced Object Oriented Programming
 * @author Kevin Apodaca, Imani Martin
 * @since 4/17/19
 * In this assignment, you are to extend your HW2 program to support
multiple items. Focus on the design of the UI. You will learn and
become familar with several Swing widgets such as JDialog, JList (or
JTable), JMenu, JPopupMenu, JMenuBar and JToolBar. Your application
shall meet all the relevant requirements from HW2 as well as the
following new ones.
R1. Provide a way to manage the list of items whose prices are to be
watched over. The user should be able to add a new item, remove an
existing item, and change an existing item, e.g., rename the item
or change its URL (see R3, R4 and R5 below).
R2. Display all watched items along with their price changes. Consider
using a JList (or JTable) for this.
R3. Use custom dialogs (subclasses of JDialog) to add and change an
item in the watch list.
R4. Improve the user interface by proving a menu and a tool bar to (a)
add a new item and (b) to check the current prices of all
items. For each menu item, provide an icon, a mnemonic and an
accelerator. For each tool bar button, use an icon and provide a
tool tip.
R5. Provide a popup menu to manipulate an indiviual item. Your popup
menu shall include menu items for:
- Checking the current price
- Viewing its webpage
- Editing it (change the name and URL; see R1 above)
- Removing it (see R1 above)
R6. Use JavaDoc to document your classes. Write a Javadoc comment for
each class/interface, field, constructor and method.
